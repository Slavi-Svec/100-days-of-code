# 100 Days Of Code - Log

Day 1: May 01, 2020 Friday 

**Today's Progress**:
FCC: Basic JavaScript: Use Recursion to Create a Countdown
FCC: ES6: Use Destructuring Assignment to Pass an Object as a Function's Parameters
Code Wars 8Kyu 

**Thoughts:** 
This is my first day of #100daysofcode. i completed 2 of the FCC questions and also a 8KYU code wars, im getting towards the end of the basic JS in the FCC questions and the recursions are quite difficult. but im slowly getting there

Day 2: May 02, 2020 Saturday

**Today's Progress**:
I completed a 7kyu Kata in codewars "Debug Basic Calculator"
and continued to work on my portfolio page in React.

**Thoughts**: 
its still taking me hours to complete a 7kyu Kata, im proud i completed it as when i started codewars even the most basic of questions seemed impossible for days for me to understand. 
and i'm starting to get the hang of passing components and understanding react.

Day 3: May 03 , 2020 Sunday 

**Today's Progress**: 
I completed a 7Kyu Kata in codewars "Dave's gamble" 
Basic JavaScript: Use Recursion to Create a Range of Numbers

**Thoughts** 
was proud of finishing this Kata, and also finally completing the whole section of basic Js in fcc
i completed the last question today. im feeling great about starting the new week tomorrow and will be completing a few projects soon.

Day 4: May 04, 2020 Monday 

**Today's Progress**:
Redid my FCC tribute page tribute of david brent 
code wars 7KYU 'Debug the functions EASY'
and I have started working on the FCC front end certificate questions 


**Thoughts** 
Today I changed my FCC tribute page and have alost completed it. I now fully understand how to align items easy by using
1 - Display: flex;
2 - flex-direction: column;
3 - Justify-content: centre;
these 3 actions have made everything easy as flexbox does all the heavy lifitng in css. 
i also am getting better at using for loops and higher order arrays, need more practice

Day 5: May 05, 2020 Tuesday

**Today's Progress**:
Completed FCC tribute page, code wars - 8 kyu Convert a Boolean to a String, 8 kyu Reversed Strings
and completed 4 questions from the ES6 section in FCC 

**Thoughts** 
Im beginning to understand functions a lot more and now  starting to think of a few options when i have to answering code wars algorithms, I realise that there is multiple ways to answer a queston. WHen i first started code wars it would take me all day just to figure out what the questions was asking me to do, now i know the answer and just have to get the correct syntax. I have fisished my tribute page and looks good.

Day 6: May 06, 2020 Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Completed 9 questions from FCC ES6, continued to work on my FCC survey page, completed Codewars 8 kyu A Needle in the Haystack

**Thoughts**:  Im starting to get some good progress in the Javascript ES6 algorithms and understanding the concepts. Im nearly completed the Survery form and i spend hours trying to complete some array challenges on code wars. tomorrow i will continue practicing Arrays and how to apply for loops and map, filter ect to them. i want to solidify my understndig of these. I had a long day trying these array methods.

Day 7: May 07, 2020 Thursday 

**Today's Progress**: completed the last question of the Javascript ES6 algorithms, 6 questions form the Regular Expressions, worked on my survey page and completed Codewars 8 kyu Array plus array and 8 kyu Abbreviate a Two Word Name

**Thoughts**:  I had a good day learning more about higher order array methods, I used a reduce method and learned how to merge 2 arrays by using this (arr1.concat(arr2)) also how to split arrays using .split() and join arrays using .join(). I was a litle bit tired this afternoon but i got thru it all. i also spent some time fixing up my FCC survey page as well.

Day 10: May 10, 2020 Sunday

**Today's Progress**:
Completed 7 questions from FCC Regular Expressions.
Codewars 8 kyu Find the smallest integer in the array

**Thoughts**: 
after getting thru most of the challenges in the FCC im learning how to use the regex to match passwords in strings and other characters. Also i used the destructuring assignment and Math.min to find the smallest integer in an array.

Day 11: May 11, 2020 Monday 

**Today's Progress**: 
Completed the last 5 questions from FCC Regular Expressions. Completed all 12 questions from FCC Debugging and Codewars 8 kyu string repeat.

**Thoughts**:
I used text align centre to correct some code and now when the page is responsive the text stays in the middle, i also got thru the whole section of FCC debugging quite easy as a lot of the errors i have already had to correct in my code in the past, i was a little distracted today but managed to put in a good day of coding, i think im starting to undertand the arrays and for loops a lot more because of the practice im putting in.

**Today's Progress**: 
Completed 9 questions from FCC Basic Data Structures, continued to work on my product landing page and completed Codewars 7 kyu You're a square! and 8 kyu Convert a String to a Number!

**Thoughts**:  
I uesd the Math.sqrt to find the square root of a number and using a for loop to find the answer on codeWars you're a square i then refactored it into one line. i had a productive day coding. I also am getting good practice using pop() and push() and Shift() and unshift(), an using the spread operator in Arrays.

**Today's Progress**: 
Completed 4 questions from FCC Basic Data Structures, continued to work on my product landing page and completed Codewars 7 kyu Square Every Digit and 8 kyu Simple multiplication

**Thoughts**:  
I spent hours trying to center text over an imge on my product landing page and learned to use transform: translate(-50%, -50%); it make the job a lot easier. I continued to learn about array methods from FCC and i figured out the Array.from method and a differend way to split strings in js on code wars. I put in another good day of coding, tomorrow im going to correct a lot of the layout of my product landing page.

Day 15: May 15, 2020 Friday

**Today's Progress**: 
Today i completed 6 questions form the FCC Basic Data Structures and completed it, also 2 questions from basic algorithm scripting. and also researched more info for my portfolio 

**Thoughts**:  
Im going to try and double up on the time i spend on FCC to get the algorithm challenges complete then i can go back to code wars. it friday and shops are allowing 10 people in them in Sydney so it looks like a bit of normality outside during this corona virus pandemic. i learned today that i can add UI to some of my coding challenges, to make them even more interesting.
