Day 2: May 02, 2020 Saturday

**Today's Progress**:
I completed a 7kyu Kata in codewars "Debug Basic Calculator"
and continued to work on my portfolio page in React.

**Thoughts**: 
its still taking me hours to complete a 7kyu Kata, im proud i completed it as when i started codewars even the most basic of questions seemed impossible for days for me to understand. 
and i'm starting to get the hang of passing components and understanding react.

Day 4: May 04, 2020 Monday 

**Today's Progress**:
Refactored my FCC tribute page tribute of david brent 
code wars 7KYU 'Debug the functions EASY'
and I have started working on the FCC front end certificate questions 


**Thoughts** 
Today I refactored my FCC tribute page and have alost completed it. I now fully understand how to align items easy by using
1 - Display: flex;
2 - flex-direction: column;
3 - Justify-content: centre;
these 3 actions have made everything easy as flexbox does all the heavy lifitng in css. 
i also am getting better at using for loops and higher order arrays, need more practice
